# getting-and-cleaning-data-final-project

Hey guys, here is my final project for the John Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera class. Here is a description of the files:

run_analysis.R: this is the script for loading the data and transforming it and then exporting the tidy data set at the end

tidy_run_analysis.txt: this is the new tidy data set containing the mean of each variable for each person for each activity

Codebook.md/Codebook.Rmd/Codebook.html: this is the new codebook explaining the data, transformations applied to the data, and the new variable names and their meanings

UCI HAR Dataset: this is the original data used for this project
